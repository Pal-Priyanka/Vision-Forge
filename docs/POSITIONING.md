## Resume / CV One-Liner
> "Architected and deployed a FAANG-grade monorepo for real-time neural architecture benchmarking, integrating YOLOv5 and DETR via an asynchronous FastAPI engine and High-Fidelity React portal."

## Recruiter Pitch
"Vision-Forge is a production-grade benchmarking platform that quantifies the trade-offs between CNN and Transformer architectures for object detection. It features a scalable monorepo layout, multi-stage Docker orchestration, and a real-time telemetry engine. The project demonstrates advanced competency in Full-Stack Engineering, AI Inference Optimization, and DevOps automation."

## LinkedIn Description
"I'm excited to share **Vision-Forge**, a project focused on the 'Neural Arena'—a comparative benchmarking engine for computer vision.

**Key Technical Highlights:**
- **Monorepo Architecture**: High-speed development with unified apps/ and core/ domains.
- **Asynchronous Inference**: Leverages Python FastAPI and multi-threading for parallel YOLOv5 and DETR execution.
- **Production DevOps**: Multi-stage CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions and Kubernetes-ready containerization.
- **Premium UX**: A glassmorphism-inspired React Dashboard for real-time performance telemetry (mAP, PR Curves, Latency Histograms).

Vision-Forge is an investment-ready platform designed for enterprise scalability. For technical specifications, refer to the architecture documentation.
